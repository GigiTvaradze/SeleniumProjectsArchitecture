*What is GitHub used for?
GitHub allows you to create, store, change, merge, and collaborate on files or code.
Any member of a team can access the GitHub repository (think of this as a folder for files) and see the most recent version in real-time.
Then, they can make edits or changes that the other collaborators also see.
GitHub also lets users make requests of one another and internally discuss the iterations along the way.
It’s even been called “a social coding platform” because it invites people to coordinate, share, and collaborate code across distributed and asynchronous environments.

What’s the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is the version control system GitHub uses.
Git is open source and free to use  for small and large projects.
It is the system that keeps track of every change you make in GitHub.
GitHub, meanwhile, is where people can share and collaborate on the files they have created.

Go to project folder that you would like to create a repo within.
You'll first cd to the root project folder and then execute the git init command.

**git init
To create a new repo, you'll use the git init command.
git init is a one-time command you use during the initial setup of a new repo.
Executing this command will create a new .git subdirectory in your current working directory.
.git makes possible to start recording revisions of the project.
This will also create a new main branch.
