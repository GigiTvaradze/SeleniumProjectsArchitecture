*What is GitHub used for?
GitHub allows you to create, store, change, merge, and collaborate on files or code.
Any member of a team can access the GitHub repository (think of this as a folder for files) and see the most recent version in real-time.
Then, they can make edits or changes that the other collaborators also see.
GitHub also lets users make requests of one another and internally discuss the iterations along the way.
It’s even been called “a social coding platform” because it invites people to coordinate, share, and collaborate code across distributed and asynchronous environments.
