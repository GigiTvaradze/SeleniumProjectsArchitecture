*What is Git?
Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in computer files. It is generally used for source code management in software development.

.Git is used to tracking changes in the source code
.The distributed version control tool is used for source code management
.It allows multiple developers to work together
.It supports non-linear development through its thousands of parallel branches

*What is GitHub used for?
GitHub allows you to create, store, change, merge, and collaborate on files or code.
Any member of a team can access the GitHub repository (think of this as a folder for files) and see the most recent version in real-time.
Then, they can make edits or changes that the other collaborators also see.
GitHub also lets users make requests of one another and internally discuss the iterations along the way.
It’s even been called “a social coding platform” because it invites people to coordinate, share, and collaborate code across distributed and asynchronous environments.

What’s the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is the version control system GitHub uses.
Git is open source and free to use  for small and large projects.
It is the system that keeps track of every change you make in GitHub.
GitHub, meanwhile, is where people can share and collaborate on the files they have created.

Go to project folder that you would like to create a repo within.
You'll first cd to the root project folder and then execute the git init command.

**git init
To create a new repo, you'll use the git init command.
git init is a one-time command you use during the initial setup of a new repo.
Executing this command will create a new .git subdirectory in your current working directory.
.git makes possible to start recording revisions of the project.
This will also create a new main branch.

Edit .gitignore file.This allows you to specify certain files or directories that you don't want to include in your repository,
such as temporary files, build artifacts, or sensitive information.

**git status
About 359,000,000 results (0.31 seconds)
The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.

**git add .
The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.
This will not add the files specified in .gitignore.

**git commit -m "Initial commit"
Once you've added the files, commit them to the repository with a descriptive message.(First Git Commit)

**git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
Once you've created a repository on GitHub, set it as the remote for your local repository.
Replace <username> and <repository> with your GitHub username and repository name.

**git push -u origin master
Finally, push your local commits to the remote repository.
